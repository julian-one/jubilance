# Jubilance

In the kitchen's dance, delight unfolds, \
Ingredients mingling, stories untold. \
With AWS CDK and TypeScript, I sway, \
Cooking a recipe, coding my way.


The flavors simmer, the API takes shape, \
AWS CDK's power, a landscape to drape. \
Jubilance rises, as lines come alive, \
Creating harmony, where tech and taste thrive. 

Whisks and keyboards, an unlikely pair, \
But in this fusion, jubilance we share. \
Cooking and coding, a symphony they become, \
Savoring each byte, with a jubilant hum. 

So let us rejoice, in this culinary delight, \
Where recipes and APIs unite. \
With AWS CDK and TypeScript, we decree, \
A jubilant feast, for all to see.
